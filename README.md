## Description
Take charge of your music experience. 

## Motivation
There are so many applications and websites these days that provide music related information. It can be exhausting to get the music you need.
Wouldn't be nice if you had one account that provided all of these updates?
Sing up for Rhino Music and take charge of your music experience
